# From Passive Yield to Active Utility

**A Quantitative Analysis of USDC Velocity and DeFi Capital Migration under the GENIUS Act**

Replication code and analysis pipeline for a quasi-experimental study of how Section 4(a)(11) of the GENIUS Act of 2025 — which prohibits permitted payment stablecoin issuers from paying yield to token holders — reshaped on-chain USDC behavior. The paper exploits the Act's enactment as a shock to the on-chain yield regime, using an interrupted time-series (ITS) design supplemented by a cross-asset difference-in-differences (DiD) with USDT (offshore-issued, outside the Act's regulatory perimeter) as the control.

## Key Findings

| Hypothesis | Result |
|---|---|
| **H1 — Velocity Acceleration** | Adjusted USDC velocity nearly doubled (0.750x → 1.484x/day). Signing (T₁) operates through a slope channel (β₃ = +0.0093 log-points/day, p < 0.001); the OCC NPRM (T₂) through a preliminary level channel. USDT shows no significant response (level p = 0.85; slope p = 0.48). Stacked DiD: USDC–USDT differential of +0.348 log-points (p = 0.008). |
| **H2 — Ternary Capital Reallocation** | Within the three-category yield panel: lending share +8.6 pp, tokenized RWA +5.1 pp, DEX liquidity share −13.8 pp (all p < 0.001). |
| **H3 — LP Concentration** | Wallet-aggregated HHI in the USDC/WETH 0.05% Uniswap V3 pool rises from 0.159 (Jun 2024) to 0.414 (Oct 2025), consistent with displacement of less-capitalized providers. |

**Mechanism.** A Baumol–Tobin extension to programmable assets: with passive yield *r* set to zero by statute while active on-chain deployment returns *ρ* remain positive, the opportunity cost of idle holding rises discretely — reversing the classical *r*-down → *V*-down prediction and producing a *forced redeployment* from passive storage to active utility.

**Timeline.** T₁ = 2025-07-18 (GENIUS Act signed, Pub. L. 119-27) · T₂ = 2026-02-25 (OCC NPRM, 91 Fed. Reg. 10,202) · Sample: 2024-01-01 → 2026-03-31 (daily).

## Reproduction

```bash
git clone https://github.com/simonanana/NBC26-A-Quantitative-Analysis-of-USDC-Velocity-and-DeFi-Capital-Migration-under-the-GENIUS-Act.git
cd NBC26-A-Quantitative-Analysis-of-USDC-Velocity-and-DeFi-Capital-Migration-under-the-GENIUS-Act
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Place input data in data/manual/ (see data/README.md), then:
cd src
python run_all.py
```

Each hypothesis module can also be run standalone (e.g. `python h2_capital_reallocation.py`). Modules degrade gracefully: if an optional input is missing, the corresponding analysis is skipped with a console notice, and H2 falls back to the public DefiLlama API.

## Methodology Summary

- **ITS (eq. 5).** `log(V_t) = α + β₁t_c + β₂Post_GENIUS + β₃(t_c × Post_GENIUS) + β₄Post_OCC + γ'X_t + ε_t`, with the time trend centered at T₁; Newey–West HAC standard errors (lag 14).
- **Cross-asset DiD (eq. 6).** Asset + week fixed effects, standard errors clustered by week; USDT as control. Robustness: 2024-only pre-period (excluding the anticipatory window), DiD stability over 4/6/9/12-month pre-windows, quarterly event study, and Wooldridge-style lead tests (`lead_3m` fails as expected — anticipatory repricing around the June 17, 2025 Senate passage — while `lead_6m` passes).
- **Structural break.** Sequential Chow (Sup-Wald, Andrews 1993) scan with 15% trimming; data-driven break at 2025-08-28, 41 days after T₁.
- **Inference transparency.** The single-asset ITS slope is not robust to permutation inference (p ≈ 0.196, reported honestly); the cross-asset DiD is therefore the primary identification of the GENIUS-specific effect.
- **Concentration.** Wallet-aggregated HHI, Gini, and Top-5 share on Uniswap V3 LP snapshots (V4 excluded: ERC-6909 singleton architecture precludes provider-level reconstruction).
